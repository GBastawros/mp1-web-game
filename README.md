# How It Works
  1- The game start when the player selects a category by clicking on any of the categories button.
  2- The clicked button will create a rundom word from the array that corresponds to the selected category.
  3- The created word is not printed (displayed), instead a number of underscores equals to the number of letters of the created word is displayed.
  4- The player makes a guess by clicking on the letter buttons under the dashed word.
  5- If the guess is true, the corresponding letter will be displayed in every correct loction(s).
  6- if the guess is false, a part of the hangman is drwon (10 parts)
  7- The game end if:
     A- The player correctly guessed all the letter and successfuly formed the generated word before consuming the 10 failed trials that corresponds to the hangman parta.
        and hence the player wins
     B- The player faied to guess all or some letters and the 10 trials are consumed (the hangmann is fully drawn). the player loses.
  Note: for the words that are of more that one part (example New York) a dash will replace the white space
